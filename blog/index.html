            <h3>Progress! - July 22nd, 2021, 9:30PM</h3>
            <p>It has been a week since the last post, and a lot has happened so far!</p>
            <p>To begin, most of the bugs in Pseudo3D that I set out to fix last week, and ones that popped up between
                then, are now fixed. Theres only one major one left to fix.</p>
            <p>Next, BoneBot 1.3.0 has been released! A lot of features were dropped from this update due to low
                probable use, as well as me not having the proper motivations. I have also archived this project, as I
                no longer have an interest in working on it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this site has received some more updates. The projects page has a new, more compact layout. The
                blog page has a more consistent theme with the rest of the site. Everything else is just small changes
                here and there.</p>

            <h3>Updates - July 14th, 2021, 1:20PM</h3>
            <p>It has been a while since I last posted, so I thought it would be a good idea to post some quick
                updates:</p>
            <p>First of all, some major bugs have popped up in the Pseudo3D physics, and I am working on fixing those.
                After that is
                done, the audio system is next.</p>
            <p>Next, I still have yet to work on BoneBot 1.3.0; however, I have been working on discarding some
                unnecessary
                features that were planned, as seen in the repo's issue list.</p>
            <p>Finally, this site has received a slight theme overhaul, with new colors, shadows, and animations
                throughout the site.</p>
            <p>I know this is not much, but for people that read this blog, I thought it would be good to let you know
                where I am at right now. I hope I can get all of this done before school resumes in about a month.</p>

            <h3>Pseudo3D Physics Rewrite Update - June 10th, 2021, 2:45PM</h3>
            <p>I have recently been working to rewrite the physics for Pseudo3D to be more accurate to real world
                physics. Today, I realized that trying to do so has brought many more issues than it would solve. Due to
                this, I have decided to revert back to the old physics, but keep some of the other new features the
                physics rewrite brought, like delta time and a proper grid system. I'm really happy this is finally
                working again! Now development is no longer at a standstill.</p>

            <h3>New Sprites For Pseudo3D - May 28th, 2021, 3:54PM</h3>
            <p>I have reworked the sprites for Pseudo3D's test scene. The old ones looked a bit flat and lifeless. These
                new ones utilize better shading to create a softer, yet better, look overall. On the left, you will see
                the old sprites inserted into the current test scene, and on the right you will find the same with the
                new sprites. I am pretty happy with how these turned out compared to the old ones.</p>

            <h3>First Blog Post - May 27th, 2021, 12:09AM</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I will probably just post project updates here occasionally. This way, all of my
                updates will be confined to my website, making it easier to keep track of them. </p>
