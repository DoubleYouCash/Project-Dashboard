            <p>I am a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University.</p>
            <p>I enjoy game-related development, as well as graphic design.</p>

            <h3>Discovering My Interests</h3>
            <p>As a child, I was obsessed with my fatherâ€™s electrical components that he stored in his garage. I would
                mess around with those until I would later create more complex circuits of my own.</p>
            <p>Later, I began to create Minecraft server plugins using Java, which then led me to gain a strong interest
                in programming itself. This swept me away from circuits, and later became my main focus.</p>

            <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>Very recently, I have explored beyond Minecraft server plugins, and I have discovered an interest in
                other game-related and miscellaneous programming projects, and occasionally graphic design.</p>
            <p>Although I strongly enjoy programming at the moment, I look forward to doing more hardware projects in
                the future as well.</p>
