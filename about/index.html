            <h3>Discovering My Interests</h3>
            <p>As a child, I was obsessed with my fatherâ€™s electronics that were in his garage. I would
                toy with those until later I'd create more complex circuits of my own.</p>
            <p>Later, I began to create Minecraft server plugins using Java, which then led to a strong interest
                in programming. This swept me away from circuits.</p>

            <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>Recently, I have explored beyond Minecraft server plugins, and I have discovered an interest in
                game-related and other programming projects, and some graphic design.</p>
            <p>Although I strongly enjoy programming, I look forward to doing more hardware projects in
                the future as well.</p>
